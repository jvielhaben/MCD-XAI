# MCD: Multi-dimensional concept discovery


This repository provides resources to reproduce results from the paper:
[Multi-dimensional concept discovery (MCD): A unifying framework with completeness guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11911). MCD provides

* a novel concept definition as low-dimensional feature sub-
spaces
* sparse subspace clustering for concept discovery
* a novel definition of concept completeness applicable to
many state-of-the-art architectures
* global and local concept relevance measures with corresponding
completeness relations

For a detailed description of technical details and experimental results, please refer to our paper:

In particular, we provide a tutorial in form of a ready-to-run jupyter notebook, which applies different variants of *MCD* on the police van class of ImageNet: **mcd_tutorial.ipynb**


# Requirements
Install dependencies from `mcd.yml` by running `conda env create -f mcd.yml` and activate the environment via `conda activate mcd`
